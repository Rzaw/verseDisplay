# verseDisplay

This is web based application that will display selected verses in OBS.
It uses Socket.io to display dynamicly verses on page. For storing those verses, we are using json files. No intentions to move to the database.

## How to use it?

Well, fire up that webserver and let's continiue.
http://webserver:8080 - this page is for displaying versers.
http://webserver:8080/sendMessage - this is where you operate. Here you can add/remove Bible verses and most importantly, display them.
